# Social Media Management Project

## Description

Welcome to the **Social Media Management Project**! This project was designed to provide a dynamic and interactive platform where users can manage their social media links and related information (such as social media name and description). The application adheres to atomic design principles and includes various Angular features like custom directives, pipes, guards, and resolvers. 

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of existing social media links.
- **Add and Edit Links**: A form to add new social media links or edit existing ones, including fields for social media name, link, and description.
- **Atomic Design Implementation**: The application is broken down into components following atomic design principles.
- **Custom Directives and Pipes**: Custom directive to validate URLs and a custom pipe to capitalize social media names.
- **Guards and Resolvers**: Guards to prevent unauthorized access and resolvers to load data before navigating to certain pages.
- **Local Storage**: Saves the state of links in the local storage for persistence.
- **API Integration**: (To be added) Simple RESTful API using NodeJS and Express for managing social media links.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be fully responsive.
- **Bonus Feature**: (To be added) A list of recently visited links stored locally and displayed on the UI.

## Known Issues

Okay, so here's the dealâ€”**the project is currently not fully functional.** ðŸ˜… But hey, nobody's perfect! I'm totally ready to iron out the wrinkles and get everything working smoothly. Just think of it as a work-in-progress with lots of potential (and a few quirks). I'm more than capable of fixing these issues, and with a bit of time, this app will be up and running perfectly! ðŸš€
